- Softare Development lifecycle
  - It is not a well defined technical term
  - You will find a lot of different versions of it

### Ranieri SDLC
1. Requirements Analysis
   1. What does the software have to accomplish?
   2. What is the scope of the application?
   3. What is the timeline?
2. Design
   1. Creating the interfaces
   2. Designing the database
   3. API routes
3. Testing/Implementation
   1. In my mind they are 2 sides of the same coin
   2. Developing the software
4. Deployment
   1. Getting your application up and running for users
5. Maitainence/Monitoring
   1. Is the application working correctly?
   2. Is it working with appropriate uptime?
   3. Can see if there are any problems?
6. Analyze the performance of your application

### Waterfall
- Process of building a product
- from the early 1900's
  - Not designed for software
  - for manufacturing in general
![Waterfall](https://www.umsl.edu/~hugheyd/is6840/images/Waterfall_model.png)
- All planned out from the beginings
  - Every detail is planned out before your start
- ***DON"T DEVIATE FROM THE PLAN***
- You only go down and forward never back!
- Good for projects that well defined end goals and strict requirements
  - Heart Monitor has very strict deadly conseuences
  - Software for a helicopter
    - You know exactly what you have to build
    - You know exactly the machine it it running on

### Agile
- Philosophy of software development
- your mindset remains agile and adaptable
- ***Change the plan if it is better***
- Has more synergy in a lot of software projects.
- Takes advantage of many software specific traits
  - Quickly prototype things
  - Software resources are very malleable
  - Software constantly changes
    - Programs get updates
    - Security vulnerabilities get exposed
    - New better software emerges
- Agile promtotes an iterative philosophy
  - You build one feature at time
  - Software specific trait
