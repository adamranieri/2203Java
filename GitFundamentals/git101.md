# git
- git is a source version control software
- All programs are really just text files
  - Programming is really just editing text files over and over again
- We want to keep track of these changes and store these text files somewhere
- GitHub and GitLab ARE NOT git
  - GitHub is like a library
  - git is the dewey decimal system
    - Way of organizing

## Everything you wanted to know about git but were too afraid to ask
- **Remote Repository**
  - A central location (GitHub) where all files for a specific project are stored
- **Local Repository**
  - A clone of the remote repository on your local machine
  - Anything you do in a local repository stays there until pushed to a remote repository
- **clone**
  - To copy a remote repository to a local machine
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/adamranieri/JavaCoreQuestions.git
```
