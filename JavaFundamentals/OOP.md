## Object Oriented Programming
- **Paradigm** of programming
  - Paradigm is a general philosophy of thinking/ approaching problems
  - Programming paradigms
    - Functional Programming
    - Aspect Oriented Programming
    - Declarative
    - Imperative
- Emphasis in OOP is on Class and **Objects**
- **Class**
  - Blue print for an object
- **Object**
  - A data structure that has state and behavior
    - **State** 
      - **Fields** 
      - Instance Variables
      - Hold data/ infromation
    - **Behvavior** 
      - **Methods**
      - They manipulate the instance variables
      - Functions bound to a specific object
- Pros
  - Can scale very well
  - Well defined code
  - Modular
  - Objects can model real world things 
- Cons
  - Does require more setup than other approaches
  - State in applications is tricky to manage in general
  - Might over complicate certain scenarios

## Pillars of OOP
- Foundational concepts of OOP
- **Abstraction**
  - Hiding implementation details
  - The implementation is not necesarry to use it
- **Polymorphism**
  - Many forms
  - An object being able to take many different labels
- **Inheritance**
  - A way for a class to derive code from another class
  - Will prevent you from repeating code snippets/methods
  - *DRY* Don't repeat yourself
    - If you find yourself writing the same method twice you need to redesign your program
- **Encapsuation**
  - Protect the state and behavior within a class
  - Prevents improper usage elsewhere in the code
    - Not at all a security feature
