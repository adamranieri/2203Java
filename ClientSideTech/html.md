# HTML

## HTML Anatomy
- Tag/Element

  - Opening and closing tag. The content goes in the middle
  - Elements can be nested. 
  - Should not overlap
  - Some tags are self closing 
- Attributes
  - Modifiers on an element 
  - Some that all elements have that attribute and others specific to an element
```HTML
    <!-- Elements/Tags are the core building block of an HTML page -->
    <p>Hello, welcome to a <b>sample</b> bit of text</p>

    <hr/><!-- self closing -->
    <img src="something.png"/>
    <!-- src is the attribute -->
```
