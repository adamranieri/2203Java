// JS has 6 primitive datatypes
// Unlike Java the primitives are still objects. Primitive is a semantic term in JS
const name = "Adam"; // string
const age = 19; //number there is not int,float,double
const isTrainer = true; // boolean
const nothing = null;// null
const wat = undefined// undefined
let a;
// symbol is the 6th primitive which I have never used
// bigint is a 7th primitive which I have also never used

// null vs undefined
// null is an explicit 'nothingness value' that must be assigned by your code
// undefined is the default value of everything in JS. you should never set things to undefined
console.log(wat)
