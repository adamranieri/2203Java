# Spring
- A lightwight *framework* for building Java applications
- **Framework**
  - **IoC Inversion of Control**
    - Your code does NOT use another person's code
    - Your code is used *by* the framework/software
    - You are creating a *spring application*
      - You must abide by their rules
      - You must abude by their patterns
      - Failure to do will prevent the application from working at all
- EJB Entity Java Beans 
  - **not related to spring**
  - People hated them
  - They were proprietary and sold by oracle
  - Spring was *free* and *better*
    - No one paid for a worse version of something that was free
  - EJBs became extinct

## Dependency Injection, Application Context and Spring Beans
- **Application Context**
  - A big container that the Spring framework will manage
- **Bean**
  - Any object/class that will be managed in the application context
  - As a Spring developer your job is to create and configure these beans
- **Dependency Injection**
  - Programming design pattern where one object will be *composed/injected* with other objects
  - A bean will often be injected with other beans
- As you work on larger projects it is unrealistic to know what most of the application code looks like.
- Having configured beans will make it easier for you to set up and run the application
- **Decoupling**
  - Removing harcoded values and dependenies within the code
  - Configurable beans that inject each other are a good example of decoupling
  - makes code very scalable
