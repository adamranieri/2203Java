# AOP
- **Aspect Oriented Programming**
  - Paradigm of programming like OOP or Functional
- **Cross Cutting Concerns**
  - Features/aspects of our application that do not fit nicely into a single layer
    - Logging
    - Security
    - Error Handling
- **Aspect**
  - Is a class that will address a CCC
- **Advice**
  - A method(s) that will be called at different locations in your code
    - Types of advice
      - @Before
        - Excutes before the method
      - @After
        - Executes after the method
      - @Around
        - Surrounds the method giving complete control over its execution
      - @AfterReturning
        - Executes after the method ONLY if the does not throw an exception
      - @AfterThrowing
        - Executes after the method ONLY if it throws an exceptions
        - Sometimes error handling is something people like to control in aspects
- **JoinPoint**
  - Any part of your code that can be *advised* an advice method is called on it
    - Spring
      - Method Excution
    - General
      - When memory deallocated
      - When an object is instantiated
- **PointCut**
  - A Regular Express that says what JoinPoints your advice method is targeting

- Pros
  - Avoid entangling code
    - Code for logging does not need to explicitly be written elsewhere in your program
  - Refactoring and modifying aspects is easy
    - If logging requirements change you only need to edit a single class
    - No tracking down all the places loggers are used
- Cons
  - Can be difficult to debug/trace
    - You have code edit how other parts of your code work with 0 evidence of it
  - Slight performance hit
