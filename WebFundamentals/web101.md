# Web 101
- Web Application
  - **A program that can respond to HTTP Requests**
- Web Server
  - Is computer that is **running** a web application
  - They are used interchangably a lot

# HTTP
- ***Hyper Text Tansfer Protocol***
  - The main way in which information travels on the web
  - HTTP HTTP(S)
    - HTTP(S) is secure but does not make it official
- HTTP is a request Response system
  - A **Client** makes an HTTP Request
    - Web Browser is an HTTP Client
    - Postman is an HTTP Client specifically for developers
      - Allows you to save your requests and some extra features like highlighting etc...
  - A **Server** responds with an HTTP Response

## HTTP Request
- **HTTP Version**
  - What version of HTTP 
- **URL**
  - *Uniform Resource Locator*
  - Where is the request going?
    - amazon.com/prodcuts
    - localhost:7000/hello
  - *Uniform Reource Identifier*
    - The path *after* the domain
    - amazon.com/products/games
      - URL: amazon.com/products/games
      - URI: /products/games
      - Domain: amazon.com
- **Body**
  - Optional
  - Some content that you are sending in the request
    - Could be a file
    - Could be text
    - Could be anything
- **Verb/Method**
  - What type of http request
  - This is an entirely semantic term
  - For the most part the verb does not have ANY real affect
  - Verbs are just conventions so deveoplers have an idea of what a request does
    - GET => requests that are *getting* infromation
      - Your browser search at the top is a GET request
    - POST => requests that are sending infromation *posting*
    - DELETE => requests that *delete* some information 
    - PUT => requests that *replace* information
    - PATCh => requests that *update* information
- **Headers**
  - Key value pairs 
  - Contain *meta* information about the request
    - Additional information about the request
  - Examples
    - Authorization keys
    - Sender credentials
    - The format of the content in the body

## HTTP Response
- **HTTP Version**
- **Headers**
  - Key value pairs
  - meta information about the response
- **Body**
  - *optional*
  - The content of a response
- **Status Codes**
  - How the response tells you the request was processed
  - 100's
    - Information 
  - 200's
    - Success
    - 200 general success message
    - 201 something was successfully created
  - 300's
    - redirects
  - 400's
    - Client side errors
    - The request is wrong 
    - 403: Forbidden you do not have permission to view this route
    - 404: you request a route that does not exist on the web app
    - 401: Unauthorized you do not have permission but its because you are not logged in and I do not know who you are
    - 418: Server is teapot
    - 451: Unavailable due to governement restrtion
  - 500's
    - Server side error
    - The *response* could not be generated/processed
    - 500's are usually indictative of bad programming
  - Status codes are NOT magical. They have to be manually assigned



## JSON
- Web Servers by their nature are programming lanauge agnostic.
  - Every single web server communicates with HTTP
  - A web server could be written in ANY lanugae
    - Java
    - Ruby
    - Python
    - .NET
    - node.js
- If a web server can be written in any programming language. How can we reliably send data to and from web servers?
  - If I tried returing a Java object that would be meaningless to a python program
  - If you tried returning an int is it signed or unsiged
- Every programming language has it's own datatypes
- **JavaScript Object Notation**
  - A *lingua franca* data type was needed to standardize communication over the web
  - What datatype is supported in every programming language?
    - **string**
    - Every programming language has some data type for storing characters
  - What is that string going to look like?
    - A format that makes it look like a JavaScript object was an easy choice
      - **JavaScript** is the langauge in web browsers
        - The most common http client

## JSON formatting
- A JSON considers of key value pairs
  - "key":value
- The keys are in quotes
- if the value is a string datatype it is in quotes
- if the value is a number it does not have quotes
- if the value is the boolean true or false it does not have quotes
```json
// firstName=Adam lastName=Ranieri age=19 isTrainer=true
{"firstName":"Adam", "lastName":"Ranieri", "age":19, "isTrainer":true}

// make,model,year
// Subaru,Crosstrek,2018
{"make":"Subaru", "model":"Crosstrek", "year":2018}

```
